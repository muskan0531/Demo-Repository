changed by Muskan


git init   //initializing(one time)
rm -rf .git //deleting git repository 

git status
git add . or git add --a (All) or git add first.txt (specific) --> add files in staging area (ready to commit)

ls (lists all the files)

touch   //create file using command line
touch .gitignore  //you include all those files you want to ignore in .gitignore (see .gitignore)

git diff (compare 2 same files ( modified and other is ready to commit) --> compare working directory with staging area
git diff --staged  --> compare previous commit with staging area

git commit -m "give some title or something so you can refer later"
git commit -a -m " text " --> direct commit(skip staging area) but we need to add untracked files seperately because those files can not directy commit 

git log --> shows all the commits you'd made

press q key --. pager will exit

when we rename a file git consider old name file as deleted and new name file as untracked file until we add that file to stage area

git rm filename with extension  --> Remove file 
							//both will stage files too 
git mv old_name new_name   --> Rename file  


//for untracking the file explicitly
git rm --cached file name with extension --> if we are tracking a file and later realised we want to ignore that file and we add that file in .gitignore but that doesn't work until  we tell explicitly to untrack the file

git clone url(url you want to insert) folder_name(you want to give to your repository folder) --> google se repositry uthana  

git log -p --> changes will be shown 
git log -p -2/-3/-4/-n  --> only n no. of commits will be shown.

git log --pretty=format:"%h -- %an" --> "google git scm.com (git log documentation for formatting).
(kisi bhi format me jese upr hmne bola place holder then 2 minus sign then author name)

git log --since=2.days --> filter applied which means only work of last 2 days.
git log --since=2.weeks
git log --since=2.months
git log --since=2.years

git commit --amend --> we will be able to amend our comment in previous comment  

but we will first have to modify then add then check status then amend .
vim editor will be shown .
i (insert)
esc then : with shift then w nd q. --> quit

git restore --staged file_name with extension -->Unstage file
